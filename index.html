                <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    I'm an aspiring IT professional with a passion for
                    technology and problem-solving.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700">
                    I recently obtained an IT Helpdesk Administrator certification. I'm currently working toward two additional 
                    COMPTIA certifications with exams/completion slated for summer/fall 2025. My goal with these
                    certifications is to enhance my skills and knowledge in the IT
                    field and transition into an IT career. 
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">    
                    This website was created over one weekend to demonstrate my
                    interest in IT, my dedication to learning new IT-related things, and my ability to implement those
                    things successfully. The site
                    will, over time, also serve as a hub for my IT journey, including a blog where I share
                    tutorials and updates, as well as my goals.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
                    I have a decade of broad experience in patient-facing healthcare. I am now pivoting to
                    IT, where I can leverage my skills and experience to help others with their
                    technology needs.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
                    I grew up in a tech-focused household with a parent in Software Development who
                    ensured I had early access to PC's and the internet at a time when
                    these technologies were not yet widely adopted. I believe my specific combination of professional
                    experience, upbringing, personal experience and interests, and current focus on COMPTIA
                    certifications, gives me a unique understanding of technology in healthcare that I can apply to my
                    work in the tech industry.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
                    I am a philomath by nature, which fuels my desire to develop a deeper understanding of things that
                    impact me and things I find interesting. This includes gardening and landscaping, DIY home
                    improvements, health, science, technology, and many other things. I also treasure spending time with
                    my family and pets.
